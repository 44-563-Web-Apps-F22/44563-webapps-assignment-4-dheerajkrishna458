    <h6 class="name">JULIA.</h6>     <p class="speech"> You forget my special magic</p>
       <p class="directions"> (In a high dramatic sense)</p>

  <p class="speech"> in situations tragic—
        Undeniably intense.
  As I've justified promotion
        In the histrionic art,
  I'll submit to you my notion
        Of a first-rate part.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LUD.</h6>     <p class="speech"> Well, let us see your notion
        Of a first-rate part.</p>

        <h6 class="name">JULIA.</h6> <p class="directions">(dramatically).</p>
<p class="speech"> have a rival!  Frenzy-thrilled,
  I find you both together!
My heart stands still—with horror chilled—-
  Hard as the millstone nether!
Then softly, slyly, snaily, snaky—
Crawly, creepy, quaily, quaky—
  I track her on her homeward way,
  As panther tracks her fated prey!</p>

<p class="directions">(Furiously.)</p>     <p class="speech"> I fly at her soft white throat—
  The lily-white laughing leman!
On her agonized gaze I gloat
  With the glee of a dancing demon!
My rival she—I have no doubt of her—-
So I hold on—till the breath is out of her!
        —till the breath is out of her!
