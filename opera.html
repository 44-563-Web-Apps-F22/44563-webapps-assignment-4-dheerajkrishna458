    <h4>THE GRAND DUKE</h4>
    <h5>ACT I.—Scene. Public Square of Speisesaal.</h5>
    <p>SCENE.—Market-place of Speisesaal, in the Grand Duchy of Pfennig
        Halbpfennig.  A well, with decorated ironwork, up L.C. GRETCHEN,
        BERTHA, OLGA, MARTHA, and other members of ERNEST DUMMKOPF'S
        theatrical company are discovered, seated at several small
        tables, enjoying a repast in honour of the nuptials of LUDWIG,
        his leading comedian, and LISA, his soubrette.
      
        CHORUS.
      
                    Won't it be a pretty wedding?
                          Will not Lisa look delightful?
                    Smiles and tears in plenty shedding—
                          Which in brides of course is rightful
                          One could say, if one were spiteful,
                    Contradiction little dreading,
                          Her bouquet is simply frightful—
                    Still, 'twill be a pretty wedding!
                    Oh, it is a pretty wedding!
                          Such a pretty, pretty wedding!
      
        ELSA.       If her dress is badly fitting,
                          Theirs the fault who made her trousseau.
      
        BERTHA.     If her gloves are always splitting,
                          Cheap kid gloves, we know, will do so.
      
        OLGA.       If upon her train she stumbled,
                          On one's train one's always treading.
      
        GRET.       If her hair is rather tumbled,
                          Still, 'twill be a pretty wedding!
      
        CHORUS.     Such a pretty, pretty wedding!
      
        CHORUS.
      
                    Here they come, the couple plighted—
                          On life's journey gaily start them.
                    Soon to be for aye united,
                          Till divorce or death shall part them.
      
        (LUDWIG and LISA come forward.)
      
                        DUET—LUDWIG and LISA.
      
        LUD.        Pretty Lisa, fair and tasty,
                          Tell me now, and tell me truly,
                    Haven't you been rather hasty?
                          Haven't you been rash unduly?
                    Am I quite the dashing sposo
                          That your fancy could depict you?
                    Perhaps you think I'm only so-so?
                                     (She expresses admiration.)
                    Well, I will not contradict you!
      
        CHORUS.     No, he will not contradict you!
      
        LISA.       Who am I to raise objection?
                          I'm a child, untaught and homely—
                    When you tell me you're perfection,
                          Tender, truthful, true, and comely—
                    That in quarrel no one's bolder,
                          Though dissensions always grieve you—
                    Why, my love, you're so much older
                          That, of course, I must believe you!
      
        CHORUS.     Yes, of course, she must believe you!
      
        CHORUS.
                    If he ever acts unkindly,
                    Shut your eyes and love him blindly—
                    Should he call you names uncomely,
                    Shut your mouth and love him dumbly—
                    Should he rate you, rightly—leftly—
                    Shut your ears and love him deafly.
                       Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
                          Thus and thus and thus alone
                          Ludwig's wife may hold her own!
      
        (LUDWIG and LISA sit at table.)
      
        Enter NOTARY TANNHAUSER.
      
              NOT.  Hallo!  Surely I'm not late?  (All chatter
        unintelligibly in reply.)
              NOT.  But, dear me, you're all at breakfast!  Has the
        wedding taken place? (All chatter unintelligibly in reply.)
              NOT.  My good girls, one at a time, I beg.  Let me
        understand the situation.  As solicitor to the conspiracy to
        dethrone the Grand Duke—a conspiracy in which the members of
        this company are deeply involved—I am invited to the marriage of
        two of its members.  I present myself in due course, and I find,
        not only that the ceremony has taken place—which is not of the
        least consequence —but the wedding breakfast is half
        eaten—which is a consideration of the most serious importance.
      
        (LUDWIG and LISA come down.)
      
              LUD.  But the ceremony has not taken place.  We can't get a
        parson!
              NOT.  Can't get a parson!  Why, how's that?  They're three
        a
        penny!
              LUD.  Oh, it's the old story—the Grand Duke!
              ALL.  Ugh!
              LUD.  It seems that the little imp has selected this, our
        wedding day, for a convocation of all the clergy in the town to
        settle the details of his approaching marriage with the
        enormously wealthy Baroness von Krakenfeldt, and there won't be a
        parson to be had for love or money until six o'clock this
        evening!
              LISA.  And as we produce our magnificent classical revival
        of Troilus and Cressida to-night at seven, we have no alternative
        but to eat our wedding breakfast before we've earned it.  So sit
        down, and make the best of it.
              GRET.  Oh, I should like to pull his Grand Ducal ears for
        him, that I should!  He's the meanest, the cruellest, the most
        spiteful little ape in Christendom!
              OLGA.  Well, we shall soon be freed from his tyranny.
        To-morrow the Despot is to be dethroned!
              LUD.  Hush, rash girl!  You know not what you say.
              OLGA.  Don't be absurd!  We're all in it—we're all tiled,
        here.
              LUD. That has nothing to do with it.  Know ye not that in
        alluding to our conspiracy without having first given and
        received the secret sign, you are violating a fundamental
        principle of our Association?
      
                             SONG—LUDWIG.
      
                    By the mystic regulation
                    Of our dark Association,
                    Ere you open conversation
                          With another kindred soul,
                          You must eat a sausage-roll! (Producing one.)
      
        ALL.              You must eat a sausage-roll!
      
        LUD.        If, in turn, he eats another,
                    That's a sign that he's a brother—
                    Each may fully trust the other.
                          It is quaint and it is droll,
                          But it's bilious on the whole.
      
        ALL.        Very bilious on the whole.
      
        LUD.        It's a greasy kind of pasty,
                    Which, perhaps, a judgement hasty
                    Might consider rather tasty:
                          Once (to speak without disguise)
                          It found favour in our eyes.
      
        ALL.        It found favour in our eyes.
      
        LUD.        But when you've been six months feeding
                    (As we have) on this exceeding
                    Bilious food, it's no ill-breeding
                          If at these repulsive pies
                          Our offended gorges rise!
      
        ALL.        Our offended gorges rise!
      
              MARTHA.  Oh, bother the secret sign!  I've eaten it until
        I'm quite uncomfortable!  I've given it six times already
        to-day—and (whimpering) I can't eat any breakfast!
              BERTHA.  And it's so unwholesome.  Why, we should all be as
        yellow as frogs if it wasn't for the make-up!
              LUD.  All this is rank treason to the cause.  I suffer as
        much as any of you.  I loathe the repulsive thing—I can't
        contemplate it without a shudder—but I'm a conscientious
        conspirator, and if you won't give the sign I will. (Eats
        sausage-roll with an effort.)
              LISA.  Poor martyr!  He's always at it, and it's a wonder
        where he puts it!
              NOT. Well now, about Troilus and Cressida.  What do you
        play?
              LUD. (struggling with his feelings).  If you'll be so
        obliging as to wait until I've got rid of this feeling of warm
        oil at the bottom of my throat, I'll tell you all about it.
        (LISA gives him some brandy.)  Thank you, my love; it's gone.
        Well, the piece will be produced upon a scale of unexampled
        magnificence.  It is confidently predicted that my appearance as
        King Agamemnon, in a Louis Quatorze wig, will mark an epoch in
        the theatrical annals of Pfennig Halbpfennig.  I endeavoured to
        persuade Ernest Dummkopf, our manager, to lend us the classical
        dresses for our marriage.  Think of the effect of a real Athenian
        wedding procession cavorting through the streets of Speisesaal!
        Torches burning—cymbals banging—flutes tootling—citharae
        twanging—and a throng of fifty lovely Spartan virgins capering
        before us, all down the High Street, singing "Eloia! Eloia!
        Opoponax, Eloia!" It would have been tremendous!
              NOT.  And he declined?
              LUD.  He did, on the prosaic ground that it might rain, and
        the ancient Greeks didn't carry umbrellas!  If, as is confidently
        expected, Ernest Dummkopf is elected to succeed the dethroned
        one, mark any words, he will make a mess of it.
                                                  [Exit LUDWIG with LISA.
              OLGA.  He's sure to be elected.  His entire company has
        promised to plump for him on the understanding that all the
        places about the Court are filled by members of his troupe,
        according to professional precedence.
      
        ERNEST enters in great excitement.
      
              BERTHA (looking off).  Here comes Ernest Dummkopf.  Now we
        shall know all about it!
              ALL.  Well—what's the news?  How is the election going?
              ERN.  Oh, it's a certainty—a practical certainty!  Two of
        the candidates have been arrested for debt, and the third is a
        baby in arms—so, if you keep your promises, and vote solid, I'm
        cocksure of election!
              OLGA.  Trust to us.  But you remember the conditions?
              ERN.  Yes—all of you shall be provided for, for life.
        Every man shall be ennobled—every lady shall have unlimited
        credit at the Court Milliner's, and all salaries shall be paid
        weekly in advance!
              GRET.  Oh, it's quite clear he knows how to rule a Grand
        Duchy!
              ERN.  Rule a Grand Duchy?  Why, my good girl, for ten years
        past I've ruled a theatrical company!  A man who can do that can
        rule anything!</p>
