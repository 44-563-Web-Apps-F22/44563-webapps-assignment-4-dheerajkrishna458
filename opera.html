    <h4>THE GRAND DUKE</h4>
    <h5>ACT I.—Scene. Public Square of Speisesaal.</h5>
    <p class="directions" > [Exit,weeping.]</p>
    
            <h6 class="name">JULIA.</h6>  <p class="speech"> now that everybody has gone, and we're happily
      and comfortably married, I want to have a few words with my
      new-born husband.</p>
           <h6 class="name">LUD.</h6> <p class="directions">(aside).</p> <p class="speech"> Yes, I expect you'll often have a few words
      with your new-born husband! </p> <p class="directions"> (Aloud.)</p> <p class="speech"> Well, what is it?</p>
            <h6 class="name">JULIA.</h6> <p class="speech"> Why, I've been thinking that as you and I have to
      play our parts for life, it is most essential that we should come
      to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered.
      Now, I've been considering how I can make the most of the Grand
      Duchess.</p>
           <h6 class="name">LUD.</h6> <p class="speech"> Have you?  Well, if you'll take my advice, you'll
      make
      a very fine part of it.</p>
           <h6 class="name"> JULIA.</h6> <p class="speech"> Why, that's quite my idea.</p>
           <h6 class="name">LUD.</h6>  <p class="speech"> shouldn't make it one of your hoity-toity vixenish
      viragoes.</p>
            <h6 class="name">JULIA. </h6>  <p class="speech">You think not?</p>
            <h6 class="name">LUD. </h6> <p class="speech"> Oh, I'm quite clear about that.  I should make her a
      tender, gentle, submissive, affectionate <p class="directions">(but not too
      affectionate)</p> <p class="speech">—timidly anxious to coil herself into
      her husband's heart, but kept in check by an awestruck reverence
      for his exalted intellectual qualities and his majestic personal
      appearance.</p>
            <h6 class="name">JULIA.</h6>  <p class="speech">Oh, that is your idea of a good part?</p>
            <h6 class="name">LUD. </h6> <p class="speech">Yes—a wife who regards her husband's slightest wish
      as an inflexible law, and who ventures but rarely into his august
      presence, unless  he should summon her
      to appear before him.  A crushed, despairing violet, whose
      blighted existence would culminate </p> <p class="directions">(all too soon)</p> <p class="speech">a lonely and
      pathetic death-scene!  A fine part, my dear.</p>
            <h6v class="name">JULIA. </h6> <p class="speech">Yes.  There's a good deal to be said for your view
      of it.  Now there are some actresses whom it would fit like a
      glove.</p>
            <p class="directions">(aside). </p> <p class="speech"> I wish I'd married one of 'em!</p>
            <h6 class="name">JULIA.  </h6>  <p class="speech">But, you see, I must consider my temperament. For
      instance, my temperament would demand some strong scenes of
      justifiable jealousy.</p>
            <h6 class="name">LUD. </h6>  <p class="speech">Oh, there's no difficulty about that.  You shall have
      them.</p>
           <h6 class="name"> JULIA.</h6> <p class="speech"> With a lovely but detested rival—</p>
           <h6 class="name">LUD. </h6> <p class="speech">Oh, I'll provide the rival.</p>
            <h6 class="name">JULIA. </h6> <p class="speech">Whom I should stab—stab—stab!</p>
            <h6 class="name">LUD.</h6>  <p class="speech"> I wouldn't stab her.  It's been done to death.  I
      should treat her with a silent and contemptuous disdain, and
      delicately withdraw from a position which, to one of your
      sensitive nature, would be absolutely untenable.  Dear me, I can
      see you delicately withdrawing, up centre and off!</p>
           <h6 class="name"> JULIA.</h6> <p class="speech">Can you?</p>
           <h6 class="name">LUD.</h6> <p- class="speech"> Yes.  It's a fine situation—and in your hands, full
      of quiet pathos!</p>
    
                         <h6> DUET—LUDWIG and JULIA.</h6>
    
      <h6 class="name">LUD.</h6> <p class="Song">       Now Julia, come,
                  Consider it from
                        This dainty point of view—
                  A timid tender
                  Feminine gender,
                        Prompt to coyly coo—
                  Yet silence seeking,
                  Seldom speaking
                        Till she's spoken to—
                  A comfy, cosy,
                  Rosy-posy
                        Innocent ingenoo!
                              The part you're suited to—
                              (To give the deuce her due)
                        A sweet (O, jiminy!)
                        Miminy-piminy,
                              Innocent ingenoo!
    
                                ENSEMBLE.
    </p>
    <P>CHORUS.</P>

        <P class="chorus">Your Highness, there's a party at the door—
              Your Highness, at the door there is a party—
                    She says that we expect her,
                    But we do not recollect her,
        For we never saw her countenance before!

        With rage and indignation she is rife,
              Because our welcome wasn't very hearty—
                    She's as sulky as a super,
                    And she's swearing like a trooper,
        O, you never heard such language in your life!
